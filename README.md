# Algorithms for Fixed-length Approximate String Matching.
#
# This file shows how to run the source codes (algorithms).
#
#1. Environment: The source codes should be run on GPU/CPU.
#2. There are several steps for running source codes.
#  2.a. Do "compile.csh" to compile all source codes.
#  2.b. Do "run.csh" to get the results.
